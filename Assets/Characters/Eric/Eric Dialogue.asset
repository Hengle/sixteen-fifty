  - Hi, I'm Eric! I'm a preservice teacher, studying at McGill.
  - Whereas Jake discussed the objective of this project, I can talk more about the
    social and educational aspect of 1650.
  - The true innovation of 1650 is to reimagine history as an experiential learning
    opportunity for high-school students.
  - In Quebec, all high-school students are required to pass a ministry history exam.
    In my experience, this has led many students to delay their graduation or to forego
    it entirely.
  - In order to best reach these students, we believe that we should teach them through
    a medium that they are more familiar with.
  - 1650 aims to meet the needs of high-school students by rethinking history as something
    that can be experienced.
  - What's more is that 1650 provides an opportunity to create a harmonious and fair
    historical narrative both colonizers and Indigenous Peoples can agree on.
  - To do this, a large component of our project will be to consult with traditional
    knowledge-keepers and elders of the Abenaki, Odawa, Mohawk, and Algonquin Peoples
    (all nations directly involved in the fur trade).
  - It will be our priority to ensure that the representation of these nations in
    1650 is created through a dialogue with these groups.
  - Being able to interact with these historic Indigenous groups in 1650 will help
    educate non-Indigenous youth on Indigenous cultures and provide insights to the
    complexities of history.
  - I dream of a day where as a history teacher I can assign a video game as homework
    instead of a textbook reading.
  - Thank you for your time!
