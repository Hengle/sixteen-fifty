  - Hi! My name is Jake. I study computer science at McGill.
  - Welcome to our game, 1650! Calling this a game might be a bit of stretch though!
    Instead, think of this as our application to the B21 BLUE Fellowship.
  - With the BLUE Fellowship, we will create a historically accurate educational mobile
    game targeted at Canadian high-school students. Through dialogue with historians
    and Indigenous Peoples, 1650 will be a fun historical game!
  - The engine of 1650 is built in Unity, as you may have noticed. All code and assets
    have been designed by Eric and me.
  - 1650 is set in New-France in the late 17th century (obviously). Gameplay will
    be turn-based, and the main objective will be to trade and to survive the harsh
    Canadian climate.
  - You play as a "coureur des bois", an early French settler and trader who travels
    into the interior of Canada to trade European goods for beaver furs with Indigenous
    Peoples.
  - '1650 will be as historically accurate as possible. As such, a large component
    of our project will be to consult with historians and archaeologists, such as
    those at the McCord museum. '
  - We will also consult with the Indigenous Nations we wish to include in 1650.
  - With your help, we can turn this demo into a culturally-sensitive and historically
    accurate video game about early European and Indigenous contact.
  - To find out more about why we think this is a worthwhile project, go talk to Eric!
