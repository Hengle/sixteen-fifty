  - Welcome to my shop!
  - So you're one of the new men fresh off the boat, huh? And you're looking to buy
    some supplies to get to Montreal?
  - Let's see here...
  - It doesn't look like you have enough money!
  - But I'll tell you what. Winter is coming soon, and I'm afraid I might not have
    enough firewood.
  - If you go out to the forest and get some wood, then I'll sell you these for less.
