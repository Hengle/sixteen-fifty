Meeting with Chris (30 May 2018)
================================

- Map editor?
  * Coded up in-game essentially, but saving asset representations of maps?
  * Built as an editor extension?
    - References for good editor scripting? (Unity docs are abysmal on this IMO)
- (Full disclosure: idk what MVC is:) MVC?
  * models are serializable (ultimately used for savegames?)
  * controllers hook up models and instantiate relevant prefabs / control
    objects premade in the hierarchy.
  * views don't really exist? Slash they're just what I put in the hierarchy.
- Event system
  *
